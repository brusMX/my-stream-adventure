# my-stream-adventure
This repo contains all my answers to the Javascript programming game/quiz of "Stream-Adventures".

* If you haven't done it, go and checkout http://nodeschool.io/
* If you want to start playing just install **node** and **npm**  and type 
```BASH
    npm install -g stream-adventure

This game is mostly on streams. You will learn how to interact with them and pipe one stream into another.
