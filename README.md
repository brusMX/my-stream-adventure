# my-stream-adventure
This repo contains all my answers to the Javascript programming game/quiz of "Stream-Adventures".

* If you haven't done it, go and checkout http://nodeschool.io/
* If you want to start playing just install **node** and **npm**  and in your terminal type: 
```BASH
    npm install -g stream-adventure
```

This game is mostly about streams. You will learn how to interact with them and pipe them into more streams.
The instructions are not as clear as the rest of nodeschool games and sometimes the error messages can be ambiguos, but it's really fun to play.
